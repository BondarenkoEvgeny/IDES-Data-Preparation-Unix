  "body": "## IDES Data Preparation\r\n\r\nThe [International Data Exchange Service (IDES)](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/international-data-exchange-service) is a secure managed file transfer service that allows financial institutions and tax authorities to securely send information on financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers in accordance with the [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-fatca). Files transmitted via IDES must be encrypted and packaged in accordance with published [data preparation instructions](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/ides-data-transmission-and-file-preparation). The data preparation process is an important step to ensure that information transmitted via IDES conforms to U.S security standards to safeguard sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe IDES Data Preparation Unix repository contains a sample shell script for packaging FATCA data in Unix. It has been tested in TBD and OS X El Capitan. Software frameworks for packaging FATCA data using [.NET](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-Dot-Net/) and [Java](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-Java/) are also available. Please note that there are many open market tools that produce the same results; however, the IRS does not endorse any commercial products, including any operating systems or software frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe shell script in this repository can create a FATCA data packet and decrypt a Notification. While it does not validate any of the XML, it can digitally sign, encrypt, compress and archive a FATCA data packet into a compliant .ZIP file. Furthermore, the shell script currently does not work for a Model 1 Option 2 FATCA Entity.\r\n\r\n### File Permissions\r\n\r\nUsing terminal, modify the access permissions for the shell scripts to your needs. For example, set owner read, write and execute permissions:\r\n\r\n    chmod 700 fatca_package.sh\r\n    chmod 700 fatca_unpack.sh\r\n    chmod 700 sample_package.sh\r\n    chmod 700 sample_unpack.sh\r\n\r\nFor other access permission options, consult the `chmod man` pages.\r\n\r\n### Data Packaging\r\n\r\nTo package FATCA data, update the following environment variables in `sample_package.sh`. The script `sample_package.sh` is a wrapper for `fatca_package.sh`:\r\n\r\n    UNSIGNED_XML_IN=yourUnsignedPayload.xml\r\n    RECEIVER_PUBLIC_CERT_IN=theReceiverPublic.cer\r\n    MY_PRIVATE_KEYSTORE_PKCS12_IN=yourPrivateKey.p12\r\n    MY_PRIVATE_KEYSTORE_PWD_IN=yourPrivateKeyPassword\r\n\r\nUpdate the metadata information. For example, to send a FATCA Report for tax year 2015, with no revision indicator:\r\n\r\n    FATCAEntitySenderId=yourGIIN\r\n    FATCAEntityReceiverId=theReceiverGIIN\r\n    TaxYear=2015\r\n    FATCAEntCommunicationTypeCd=RPT\r\n    FileRevisionInd=false\r\n    SenderContactEmailAddressTxt=yourEmail@yourDomain.com\r\n\r\nSave and execute the script.\r\n\r\n### Data Unpacking\r\n\r\nTo unpack a FATCA data packet (for example, to open and read a Notification) update the following environment variables in `sample_unpack.sh`. The script `sample_unpack.sh` is a wrapper for `fatca_unpack.sh`:\r\n\r\n    FATCA_PKG_IN=theDataPacketYouReceived.zip\r\n    MY_PRIVATE_KEYSTORE_PKCS12_IN=yourPrivateKey.p12\r\n    MY_PRIVATE_KEYSTORE_PWD_IN=yourPrivateKeyPassword\r\n\r\nAs an option, you can also validate the sender's signature:\r\n\r\nSENDER_PUBLIC_CERT_IN=theSenderPublic.cer\r\n\r\nSave and execute the script.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer:\r\n\r\nWe waive copyright and related rights in the work worldwide through the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication.
